# Data Science Case Studies Repository

This repository contains Data Science case studies where I store projects to practice and apply my knowledge in data analysis, predictive modeling, and segmentation techniques.

## Case Studies

1. [Credit Scoring and Segmentation](./Credit_scoring_segmentation): This case study focuses on the credit scoring process using the FICO method and customer segmentation using the KMeans algorithm.


Currently, only one case study has been stored in this repository. However, I will be adding more projects as I complete them and document them appropriately.
