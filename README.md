# Credit Scoring Case Study

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data for a data science practice project focused on credit scoring. The project uses the FICO method to calculate credit scores and segments the data using KMeans clustering to provide insights into customer creditworthiness.

The process of calculating credit scores and segmenting customers based on their credit scores involves several steps. Firstly, relevant data about borrowers, such as payment history, credit utilization, credit history, and credit mix, is collected and organized. Then, using complex algorithms and statistical models, the collected data is analyzed to generate credit scores for each borrower.

These credit scores are numerical representations of the borrowerâ€™s creditworthiness and indicate the likelihood of default or timely repayment. Once the credit scores are calculated, customers are segmented into different risk categories or credit tiers based on predefined thresholds.

This segmentation helps financial institutions assess the credit risk associated with each customer and make informed decisions regarding loan approvals, interest rates, and credit limits. By categorizing customers into segments, financial institutions can better manage their lending portfolios and effectively mitigate the risk of potential defaults.

## Introduction

In this case study, we explore the credit scoring process using the FICO method, a widely used credit scoring model. The FICO method evaluates various features and historical credit data to generate a credit score, providing an assessment of an individual's creditworthiness. Additionally, we utilize KMeans clustering to segment the data into different credit risk groups, allowing for better understanding and decision-making.

## Data
The dataset used for this case study is named credit_scoring.csv. It is provided by [https://statso.io/credit-scoring-case-study/] and contains historical credit information of customers.

## Methodology

1. FICO Credit Score Calculation: We use the FICO method to calculate credit scores for each customer based on their credit history, payment behavior, and other relevant factors.

2. KMeans Clustering: After calculating the credit scores, we apply KMeans clustering to segment the customers into different groups based on their credit risk.


## Conclusion

In this case study, we successfully applied the FICO method to calculate credit scores and used KMeans clustering to segment customers based on their credit risk. This approach can help financial institutions and lenders make more informed decisions while assessing credit applications.

Credit scoring and segmentation refer to the process of evaluating the creditworthiness of individuals or businesses and dividing them into distinct groups based on their credit profiles. It aims to assess the likelihood of borrowers repaying their debts and helps financial institutions make informed decisions regarding lending and managing credit risk.
